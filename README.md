Grateful Dead Player
This is an in-process project I'm working on. I haven't come across a decent web interface to search and stream Grateful Dead shows from Archive.org This project aims to address that- I'm planning to implement the following:

Pull a show and create a playlist (Complete)
Responsive interface for mobile function (in process)
Search Archive.org by year and pull shows
Expand above to search by dates
Expand above to search by song name
Optimize styling with modern design principles
Rebuild using React / React native, release on app store for native integration (convert from WebApp)
